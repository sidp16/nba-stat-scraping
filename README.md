# NBA Statistic Analysis
Using the [nba_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api "NBA API Repo") to delve into interesting statistics! Below are some of the Linear Regression Models I have created so far through playing around with the API and what it offers.

## Problem Statement
I have been watching and following the NBA for nearly 2 years and pride myself on being 'more than a fan' such that I want to gain a better understanding of the game to not only better my own basketball ability but to understand the numbers behind it. Channels such as [Thinking Basketball](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3HPbvB6f58X_7SMIp6OPYw "Thinking Basketball Youtube Channel"), [Heat Check](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmwxBk7Af9OnnloGZzp6JnQ "Heat Check Youtube Channel") and [BBALL BREAKDOWN](https://www.youtube.com/user/bballbreakdown "BBALL Breakdown Youtube Channel") offer in-depth analysis for several players, teams and coaching tactics. After watching these channels for the past few years I feel I have a good grasp on what stats mean and how to compare players and potentially teams. 

I love watching players such as **LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden and Steph Curry** because they each have something that makes them unique on the court - **LeBron**'s innate ability to make every player on his team a threat with his passing is unparalleled, **KD**'s all-around 2-way game gives him something no one at his height really has in today's game. A fast, agile 7 footer who can shoot over anyone at will. **James Harden**'s ability to score at will with his step-back jumpers from 3 point range is deadly and alongside this, the man can get to the free-throw line whenever he wants. All of this makes him one of the scariest players for a team to guard in the league today. And finally, **Steph Curry**, there's not much to say, the best shooter ever. Period. You have to guard this man as soon as he touches the ball because if not, all it takes is one step from half-court and he's draining it in your face.

Each of these players do have flaws as well, some minimal, some more potent. **I will be comparing LeBron James and Kevin Durant** to find out who is the better player. This includes scoring, passing, rebounding, shooting - everything. 

Each has their shortcomings - LeBron's lacklustre free throw and 3 point shooting can be detrimental. KD is lights out shooting from anywhere on the floor but doesn't have the same ability as LeBron when it comes to making his teammates better through passing and getting everyone involved. 

> ***I predict that I will reach the conclusion that overall, LeBron is the better player and asset for a team.***
